    <h2> It should
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/Version10group/something.html">look like this when you open it up.</a>
    </h2>
<h2> We should move on and learn what these six parts of an elements are, Our first one is a HTML element. An HTML element is an unit of content in an HTML document formed mainly by HTML tags and the test/media it contains.</h2>
<h2> Our second part is an HTML Tag which is normally scene in brackets. Another tag is the opening tag, as the name suggests it normally the tag who starts the entire HTML document. The Closing Tag is vise versa to the Opening Tag.</h2>
<h2>HTML is organized as a collection of family trees. When an element is contained inside another element (like pregenacy), it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.</h2>
<h2>Looking back to your inspection of the webpage you will notice that Chrome uses arrows to hold all the child elements within a drop down arrow.  Go ahead and click on the arrows and notice that when you click on head that everything in the parent is collapsed.  This can be a very useful debugging tool. 
    There are 2 main elements that contain everything head and body (with HTML5, the footer element has to be child of the body, it is not a sibling)
    Open the arrow on the body element and you will see there are 2 elements, main and footer
    Open the arrow on the main element and you will see there are 2 elements named div 
    div is just a generic container, just like the tupperware in your home they can be any size and shape, but are typically used to help keep things organized
    These 2 div elements will hold the code for this activity and the next one.  ORGANIZATION is very important when coding a web page.
     From this point you can highlight certain areas of CODE and your web-page will also highlight.  Move your cursor to highlight the line under h1 and you will see that the Heading.</h2>
